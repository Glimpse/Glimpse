Release Notes
-------------
04/16/2011 - 0.78
- Fixed pathing issues experienced by users hosting from virtual directories.
- Added Request tab to show form and query string as the server saw them.
- Added ViewData/ViewBag and TempData info to the details column of the Views tab

04/14/2011 - 0.77
- Fixed issues with most InvalidOperationException's/Circular references. Now if there is an issue, handle it more gracefully, and it only affects one tab. (More complete fix coming soon!)
- /Glimpse/Config is no longer case sensitive, and certain reports of 404’s to this page have been fixed. In addition, this page has been improved to be more understandable.
- As of right now, Glimpse only supports MVC3.  We have identified the issues with MVC2, and are working to correct them. Special shout out to @rugvedvaidya for providing the (long!) workaround to get Glimpse running on MVC2.

Using Glimpse
-------------

Thank your get NuGetting Glimpse! A client side Glimpse into whats going on in your server.

Glimpse is currently in Beta.  

If you experience any issues, or have feature requests, please report them to https://github.com/Glimpse/Glimpse/issues

To get started with Glimpse, visit [http://yoursite.com]/Glimpse/Config/ This page hosts the Glimpse bookmarklets, useful for quickly turning on Glimpse.

The following configuration values are allowed for Glimpse in your web.config:

<glimpse on="true" saveRequestCount="5"> <!-- set on to false to completly turn off Glimpse. saveRequestCount specifies the max number of requests Glimpse will save -->
    <ipAddresses> <!-- List of IP addresses allowed to get Glimpse data.  localhost (IPv4 & IPv6) by default -->
        <add address="127.0.0.1" />
        <add address="::1" />
    </ipAddresses>
    <contentTypes>
        <add contentType="text/html"/>
    </contentTypes>
</glimpse>

Overview
--------
At its core Glimpse allows you to debug your Web Service right in the browser. Glimpse allows you to "Glimpse" into what's going on in your web server. In other words what Firebug is to debugging your client side code, Glimpse is to debugging your server within the client.

Fundamentally Glimpse is made up of 3 different parts, all of which are extensible and customizable for any platform:

* Glimpse Server Module 
* Glimpse Client Side Viewer 
* Glimpse Protocol


How it Works
------------
On the Server:

1. Server collects all server side information that will aid in debugging (i.e. application settings, routes, session variables, trace data, etc)
2. It does this by running through a pipeline of server side data providers that can be dynamically controlled and added to under plugin architecture
3. Before the response is send, the server formats this data in accordance with the Glimpse Protocol and serializes it as JSON
4. Depending on whether it is a Ajax request or not, the server embeds the JSON in the HTTP Header or in the content of the page

On the Client:

5. Depending on whether it is a Ajax request or not, the picks up the JSON data and to the data set by executing a pipeline of client side data providers that can be dynamically controlled and added to under plugin architecture
6. The client side module then dynamically renders a client side UI (similar to Firebug Lite) that lets you view this data

Glimpse can be turned on or off by a series of different mechanistic, but at its core if the Glimpse cookie is present the server will provide the "debug" data - as a security measure, the request for debug data is "authenticated". Via the plugin model, this authentication check can have any logic that is required by the site to ensure that unauthorized users don't have access to sensitive debug data.

 
Server Implementations 
----------------------
Given the scope of the project and what it can do, the concept isn't restricted to any one platform. Hence, once mature, Glimpse Server Module will be available on all major web platforms. 

Platforms currently supported:

* ASP.Net Web Forms 
* ASP.Net MVC 

Platforms soon to be supported supported:

* PHP
* Ruby on Rails 

NOTE - If you would like help develop a Glimpse Server Module for a given platform please let us know.


Client Implementations 
----------------------
To start with the Glimpse Client Side Viewer is simply a light weight JavaScript "plugin" that understands the Glimpse Protocol and knows how to render the data. From a technology standpoint we currently use jQuery as the client side framework.

Eventually, we would like to have actual browser plugins that provide richer functionality and experience, but the JavaScript version of the Glimpse Client Side Viewer is surprisingly well featured, intuitive and provides a high fidelity experience. We also hope to have a version for mobile ready soon which customizes the viewing/usage experience when using a mobile device.
