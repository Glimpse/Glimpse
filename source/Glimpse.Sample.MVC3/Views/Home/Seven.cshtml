<h2 class="musicHeadline">Famed tenor delivers high Cs and baby in NYC</h2>
<p class="musicArticle">Tenor Juan Diego Florez has really delivered: a host of high Cs to a worldwide audience of millions — and minutes earlier, his own baby boy in New York City.<br /><br />Florez helped two midwives in the birth of his son, Leandro Florez, at 12:25 p.m. Saturday. The tenor had stayed up all night with his wife, Julia, after she went into labor at their rented apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side.<br /><br />While the couple awaited the birth of their first child, the world waited for the 38-year-old Peruvian to sing the tenor lead in Rossini's comic opera "Le Comte Ory" at the nearby Metropolitan Opera — starting at 1 p.m.<br /><br />The baby got the cue: He bawled first.</p>
